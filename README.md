# create-flask-app
Something I built for personal use. It works but is super basic right now.

Add the following to your .bash_profile. It'll add the create-flask-app command to terminal. After this you can run **create-flask-app** and an very basic flask app will be created for you
'''
alias create-flask-app="git clone git@github.com:ashbhat/create-flask-app.git; rm -rf create-flask-app/.git;rm -rf create-flask-app/.gitignore;"
'''
